A physical, industrial-grade autonomous mobile robot designed for dynamic warehouse environments. This project features a complete hardware-software stack, combining 3D visual SLAM, custom embedded ESP controllers via `ros2_control`, a dynamic Z-axis scanning lift, and a GPU-accelerated computer vision pipeline for highly reliable QR code inventory tracking.
Developed and validated through rigorous Gazebo Ignition simulations before successful deployment in a physical testing arena.

✨ Core System Features
🗺️ 3D Mapping & Navigation (RTAB-Map & Nav2)
Visual SLAM: Utilizes RTAB-Map with RGB-D input to fuse odometry and visual features into a graph-based representation, incorporating loop-closure to eliminate drift.
Dynamic Path Planning: * Global Costmap: A* routing for long-distance warehouse navigation.
Local Costmap: Voxel-based 3D geometry tracking to avoid overhanging shelves and dynamic obstacles.
Trajectory Smoothing: Dynamically feasible reference trajectories enforcing strict acceleration/speed limits for tight spaces.
👁️ Two-Stage Scanning Vision Pipeline
Engineered to handle noise, uneven warehouse lighting, and motion blur using 640x480 RGB camera feeds.
Stage 1 (Direct): Fast, raw-frame decoding via ZXing-CPP.
Stage 2 (Fallback Preprocessing): If direct decoding fails, the system applies grayscale conversion, 3x3 Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, and contrast scaling (α = 1.5) before re-submitting to the decoder with homography perspective correction.
⚙️ Hardware Integration & `ros2_control`
Middleware: Powered by Cyclone DDS for deterministic, low-latency publish-subscribe communication.
`diff_drive_esp` Plugin: A custom hardware interface translating ROS 2 `cmd_vel` topics into UART commands for an ESP-based motor controller, processing closed-loop encoder feedback for precise odometry.
`z_axis_esp` Plugin: Controls a vertical lift mechanism via local PID, moving the camera payload to dynamically calculated heights for multi-level shelf scanning.
📱 Human-Machine Interface (HMI)
Mobile Application: Provides remote supervision, live video telemetry, inventory scan readouts, and manual override capabilities.
Capacitive Touchscreen: Onboard display for real-time diagnostics (voltage, current, thermals) and local fallback control.

🛡️ Industrial Fail-Safes & Safety
Hardware Clamping: Firmware-level outlier detection discards out-of-bounds velocity commands before they reach the motors.
Dynamic E-Stop: Software triggers an immediate emergency stop if unmapped obstacles suddenly appear in the local costmap.
Perception Watchdog: If the camera feed crashes, the respective ROS 2 node is automatically killed and restarted while the rover safely maintains localization.
Human-in-the-Loop: Instant manual override and halt capabilities via the mobile application over the DDS network.
---
🏗️ System Architecture & Deployment
The entire software stack is fully encapsulated using Docker, ensuring consistency from simulation to physical deployment.
Target Compute: NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.
Hardware Acceleration: The NVIDIA Docker runtime exposes CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT to the perception and planning pipelines.
Modular Containers: Navigation, perception, and hardware control run in isolated, easily updatable containers to prevent dependency conflicts.
